    "text": "Ongoing Research\nSpin3D utilizes our 3D audio dome infrastructure to simulate realistic acoustic environments. This platform allows us to test auditory perception and hearing device performance in complex, dynamic scenarios that mimic real-world challenges, moving beyond standard audiometric testing.\nHearHere is a Citizen Science initiative that maps sensory challenges in the urban soundscape. Using the custom “CS-Logger” app, we record environmental noise and subjective hearing experiences to identify urban hotspots and increase the ecological validity of our lab experiments.\nHLC_Audio focuses on advanced real-life audio analysis, bridging the gap between controlled lab settings and complex, noisy environments where hearing challenges truly emerge.\nThe Silence-Illusion Paradigm investigates how the brain constructs auditory reality by contrasting Auditory Illusions (context-driven filling-in) with Silence Perception (input suppression). This project aims to map the “Prediction-Sensation” spectrum across neuroatypical groups (Tinnitus, ASD, ADHD), establishing objective biomarkers for sensory processing disorders.\nFire full-stack physiological EEG paradigm we iterate to develop a method to study fatigue and fatiguability in auditory processing.\nANT (Advancing Neurofeedback in Tinnitus) develops next-generation neurofeedback protocols, bridging computational modeling with clinical application to treat tinnitus.\nTEAS (Neuromodulation in Tinnitus) investigates non-invasive electrical stimulation techniques to modulate auditory cortex activity and provide relief for tinnitus patients."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

We combine psychophysics, psychoacoustics, neuroimaging, and 3D audio simulations to understand the full spectrum of hearing disorders—including hearing loss, tinnitus, and hyperacusis—as well as the neurodiverse reality of auditory processing. Our transdisciplinary approach integrates medicine, neuroscience, psychology, engineering, and computer science to develop methods, technology, objective biomarkers and therapies for normal and pathological hearing.\n\nResearch Approach\nOur philosophy is defined by three core pillars:\n\nEcological Validity: We bridge the gap between reductionist lab settings and the real world. By utilizing 3D audio domes, auditory scene analysis and mobile Citizen Science apps, we capture the complexity and challenges of hearing in daily life.\nFull-Stack Engineering: We adopt a philosophy of engineering our own experimental ecosystems, from custom hardware and acquisition setups to computational pipelines. This ensure transparency, interoperability, and sustainability of research output.\nOpen Science & Reproducibility: We are committed to the principles of reproducible science and build open-source methodologies for the hearing and broader scientific community."
