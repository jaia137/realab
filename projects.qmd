## Ongoing Research

**Spin3D** utilizes our 3D audio dome infrastructure to simulate realistic acoustic environments. This platform allows us to test auditory perception and hearing device performance in complex, dynamic scenarios that mimic real-world challenges, moving beyond standard audiometric testing.

**HearHere** is a Citizen Science initiative that maps sensory challenges in the urban soundscape. Using the custom "CS-Logger" app, we record environmental noise and subjective hearing experiences to identify urban hotspots and increase the ecological validity of our lab experiments.

**HLC_Audio** focuses on advanced real-life audio analysis, bridging the gap between controlled lab settings and complex, noisy environments where hearing challenges truly emerge.

**The Silence-Illusion Paradigm** investigates how the brain constructs auditory reality by contrasting *Auditory Illusions* (context-driven filling-in) with *Silence Perception* (input suppression). This project aims to map the "Prediction-Sensation" spectrum across neuroatypical groups (Tinnitus, ASD, ADHD), establishing objective biomarkers for sensory processing disorders.

**Fire** is a large-scale epidemiological study tracking tinnitus prevalence and health metrics across Switzerland, providing essential data for understanding the public health impact of hearing disorders.

**ANT (Advancing Neurofeedback in Tinnitus)** develops next-generation neurofeedback protocols, bridging computational modeling with clinical application to treat tinnitus.

**TEAS (Neuromodulation in Tinnitus)** investigates non-invasive electrical stimulation techniques to modulate auditory cortex activity and provide relief for tinnitus patients.
